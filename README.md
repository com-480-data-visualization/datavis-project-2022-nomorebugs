# Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)
## Dataset
## Problematic
Our inspiration comes from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® ([MBTI®](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/)) personality inventory. Its purpose was to make the theory of psychological types understandable and useful in people's lives. We explored four related datasets, hoping to gain insights from different perspectives. People can take a test on [16Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test), then get more inspiration from this project.

The main axis we would like to develop are the following:

- How are different personality types distributed around the world? What is the dominant type in each country?
- Do different types of person post differently? What are their main topics?
- What are the personality types of some well-known movie characters? Are there any predispositions to characters in different movies genres?
- Is there any connection between personality type and birthday?
