## Related work
We researched on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) (since we got our datasets from here) if there were other visualization utilizing the datasets we use. However, there are no additional work including all of our dataset. Most of the work just cover one dataset and present basic visualization. Our approach is original because there are no previous work concerning all of these aspects: MBTI expression pattern, movie character MBTI, birthday-MBIT distribution, and world-wide MBIT distribution. 

We also searched on internet and found that there are many commercial MBTI test websites that present data visualization using the data collected from their own website. We need to declare here that our datasets are different from those websites, as they made money on the data and therefore their datasets are not open source. We were especially inspired by a [website](https://www.16personalities.com/country-profiles/global/world) that visualizes personality data on a global map. But this visualization only concerns dichotomy, such as Extraversion(E) vs Introversion(I), not 16 personalities. Our project could extend this website by presenting visualization using multiple datasets (expression pattern, movie character MBTI, birthday-MBIT distribution), and further the world-wide MBIT visualization by allowing specific personalities proportion comparison.

It should be noted that we have never used these datasets in any of our previous works.
